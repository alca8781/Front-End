    border-box 
        overal dimentions = specified size + margin
            - must set width and height properties 
            - width and height properties determine size of the content, padding, and border portion of the box 

    content-box
        overall dimentions = specified size + padding + border + margin
            - default style for all box elements 
            - width and height properties determine size of the content portion of the box 


RESPONSIVE DESIGN 
    - use : rem or em % 
    - min-width, min-hight, maz-width, max-height
    - display:flex


FLEXBOX 
    - display:flex; 
    makes display a flexible layout 

    flex-direction : row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse; 

        flex-direction: row; 
            - lay children elements in the writing direction of page (L to R)
        flex-direction: column; 
            - lay children elements top-to-bottom 

    flex-wrap : wrap | nowrap; 
        - determins whether or ont children in container are wrapped onto a new line 
        
        flex-wrap: wrap; 
            - default setting 
            - will wrap children to new line 
        flex-wrap: nowrap; 
            - prevent children from wrapping to new line -> flex-shrink instead 

FLEXFLOW 
    flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>; 
        - combines properties into one 

        EX: 
            flex-flow: row nowrap; 
            flex-flow: column; 
            flex-flow: column-reverse wrap; 
            flex-flow: row-reverse nowrap; 

JUSTIFY CONTENT 
    justify-content: normal | center | start | end | stretch | space-between | space-around | space-evenly: 
    - controls the position of non-growing children along main axis 

ALIGN ITEMS 
    align-items: normal | center | start | end | baseline | stretch; 
    - controls position of all children along cross axis of container 

FLEXBOX CHILD PROPERTIES 
    flex-basis: <size>; 
        - determines starting size of an element 
        - units must be rem,em,px,% 
        - setting width of child 
    flex-grow: <number>; 
        - determines growth reletive to other siblings 
            child -> flex-grow: 0;   wont grow 
            child -> flex-grow: 1;   grow to fill extra space 
            child -> flex-grow: 3;   grow 3x more than any siblings that have flex-grow: 1; 
                                     grow .5x of siblings with flex-grow: 6; 
    flex-shrink: <number>; 
        - determines  shrink relative to other siblings 
            child -> flex-shrink: 0;   wont shrink 
            child -> flex-shrink: 1;   shrink to accomodate siblings 
            child -> flex-shrink: 3;   shrink 3x more than any siblings that have flex-shrink: 1; 
                                       shrink .5x of siblings with flex-shrink: 6; 
    
    flex: <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>: 
        - combines properties into 1 

        ex: 
            flex: 0 1 200px; => flex-grow:0; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 200px; 
            flex: 1 1; => flex-grow:1; flex-shrink:1; 
            flex: 2 30rems; => flex-grow:2; flex-basis:30rems; 


GRID 
    display: grid; 
    grid-template-columns 
        - defines number and size of columns in grid 
        - take unlimited number of values seperated by spaces
